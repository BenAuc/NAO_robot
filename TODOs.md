# TODOs:

General:

-install sklearn, see short instructions in the folder "notes" of the ros package

In PenaltyKick class of FootPlayer node:

- Connect a push button to set the flat "agentReadiness" to True and start iterating. The status of this flag is checked in penaltyKick.run()

## agent_environment_model.py

 - DONE: Connect the parameters that are used to initialize the Agent model with the measured values:

   - DONE: `hip_joint_start_position`: hip roll at the moment when we start the RL algorithm -> random number within limits generated by the football player node and passed on to constructor of Agent 
   - DONE: `goalkeeper_x`: x coordinate of the goalkeeper (in the camera frame) -> measured as center of aruco marker, the agent doesn't do anything as long as this marker hasn't been detected
   - DONE: `goal_lims`: x coordinates of the goal posts (in the camera frame) -> measured with the AruCo markers, same as previously
 
 - Find empirical limits of the hip roll (for finding the leg displacement)
 - DONE: Find empirical limits of the knee (for kicking the ball) -> see method of PenaltyKick class "kick_ball()". I don't see the need for empirical limits beyond this method.

 - DONE: Create function for upright posture: we could use posture proxies for that (http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-1/naoqi/motion/alrobotposture.html) or simply `Agent.set_joint_angles()` -> proxies don't offer a standing position on one leg. Upright position set in run() method of PenaltyKick class
 - Write `Agent.execute_action()` to execute the movement on the robot, according to the selected action id
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95912004/179284462-84d2415f-b95c-41af-8de0-e80e63fb5ca1.png)
 - Connect `self.hip_joint_position` with a subscriber to the corresponding topic
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95912004/179284753-c56603d3-9f0e-4cc5-b987-3deb09f5f8de.png)
   On the image, we see a portion of the step function. After the call to `execute_action(action_id)` (see previous point), we expect the hip joint position to change.
   Thus, we fetch it from the rostopic and compute our new state. The first line on this image is hardcoded to "fake" a new measurement, since we don't know the real value yet.
 - Write the functions to plot the training progress over the episodes
 - **Train the robot (needs to be done at the lab)**
